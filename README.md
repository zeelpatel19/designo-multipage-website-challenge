# designo-multipage-website (Frontend Mentor)

This is my personal solution to the [designo-multipage-website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/designo-multipage-website-G48K6rfUT).

### The challenge

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
- Use a JavaScript framework/library to practice templating and/or building using components

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - React framework
